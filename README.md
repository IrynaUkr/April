## task5.LoopsI
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

Task
Given an integer, , print its first  multiples. Each multiple
(where ) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print  lines of output; each line  (where ) contains the  of  in the form:
N x i = result.
## task6.LoopsII
We use the integers a,b and n to create the following series:

You are given  queries in the form of a,b and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and  values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective , , and  values for that query.

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

## task7. Java DataTypes
Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.
Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.

Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case, , is comprised of a single line with an integer, , which can be arbitrarily large or small.

Output Format

For each input variable  and appropriate primitive , you must determine if the given primitives are capable of storing it. If yes, then print:

n can be fitted in:
* dataType
  If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size (i.e.: ).

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, print the line:

n can't be fitted anywhere.
## task8.End Of File
The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

## task13. String Tockens
Given a string, , matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+,
split the string into tokens. We define a token to be one or more consecutive 
English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format- A single string, .

Constraints

is composed of any of the following: English alphabetic letters,
blank spaces, exclamation points (!), commas (,), question marks (?),
periods (.), underscores (_), apostrophes ('), and at symbols (@).
Output Format

On the first line, print an integer, , denoting the number of tokens in 
string  (they do not need to be unique). Next, print each of the  tokens 
on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string .


## task 14. Pattern Syntax Checker 
Using Regex,
we can easily match or search for patterns in a text. Before searching for a pattern, we have to specify one using some well-defined syntax.

In this problem, you are given a pattern.
You have to check whether the syntax of the given
pattern is valid.

Note: In this problem, a regex is only valid if you can compile it using the Pattern.compile method.

### Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer , denoting the number of test cases. The next  lines contain a string of any printable characters representing the pattern of a regex.

### Output Format

For each test case, print Valid if the syntax of the given pattern is correct. Otherwise, print Invalid. Do not print the quotes.

## task 15. String Introduction
Given two strings of lowercase English letters,  and , perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of  and .
Determine if  is lexicographically larger than  (i.e.: does  come before  in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
### Input Format

The first line contains a string . The second line contains another string . The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

### Output Format

There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of  and .
For the second line, write Yes if  is lexicographically greater than  otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

##task 16 Java Substring Comparisons
Given a string, , and an integer, , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length .

Function Description

Complete the getSmallestAndLargest function in the editor below.

getSmallestAndLargest has the following parameters:

string s: a string
int k: the length of the substrings to find
Returns

string: the string ' + "\n" + ' where and are the two substrings
### Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting .
The second line contains an integer denoting .

##  task 16 Pallindrom
Given a string , print Yes if it is a palindrome, print No otherwise.

Constraints(will consist at most  lower case english letters.)

## task 17 Anagram
Two strings,  and , are called anagrams if they contain all the same characters in the same frequencies. For this challenge, the test is not case-sensitive. For example, the anagrams of CAT are CAT, ACT, tac, TCA, aTC, and CtA.

Function Description

Complete the isAnagram function in the editor.

isAnagram has the following parameters:

string a: the first string
string b: the second string
Returns

boolean: If  and  are case-insensitive anagrams, return true. Otherwise, return false.
Input Format

The first line contains a string .
The second line contains a string .

Constraints

Strings  and  consist of English alphabetic characters.
The comparison should NOT be case sensitive.

## Test Balanced Brackets
A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket
(i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) 
of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched.
For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. 
The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, 
(, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

It contains no unmatched brackets.
The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of
brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. 
If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

Function Description

Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

string s: a string of brackets
Returns

string: either YES or NO
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
Each of the next  lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.

Constraints

, where  is the length of the sequence.
All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
Output Format

For each string, return YES or NO.
